        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">June 17 1987:</span>Kendrick Lamar, in full
            Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, was born on June 17, 1987, at Compton,
            California, U.S.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">Childhood:</span>Duckworth grew up in a
            high-crime area of Compton, where, ironically, his parents had moved
            to escape a violent milieu in Chicago. He began writing rhymes as a
            young teenager, and he released his first mixtape, Youngest Head
            Nigga in Charge (2003), under the name K. Dot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2009:</span>Releasing Overly Dedicated as
            Kendrick Lamar. He became a popular guest performer on tracks put
            out by other rappers and also joined fellow Top Dawg artists
            Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and ScHoolboy Q in a hip-hop collective known as
            Black Hippy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2011:</span>Top Dawg made Lamar’s album
            Section.80 available on iTunes, and at a concert that same year
            Lamar was ceremonially declared the “new king of the West Coast” by
            veteran rap artists Game, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2012:</span>Lamar signed with Dr. Dre’s
            label Aftermath Entertainment and released his first LP, good kid,
            m.A.A.d. City; it debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart and
            yielded the R&B/hip-hop hits “Swimming Pools (Drank)” and “Poetic
            Justice.” Critics noted that it was a concept album with an
            autobiographical narrative. Lamar was nominated for seven 2013
            Grammy Awards, including best album and best new artist, but failed
            to win. The following year, however, his single “i” took the awards
            for best rap song and best rap performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2015:</span> Lamar released To Pimp a
            Butterfly, which was a huge success. The album broke a Spotify
            record—being streamed more than 9.6 million times—within a week of
            its release, and U.S. Pres. Barack Obama declared that the single
            “How Much a Dollar Cost” was his favourite song of 2015.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2016:</span>Lamar unexpectedly released a
            new album, untitled unmastered, consisting of eight tracks that he
            described as unfinished demos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2017:</span>Lamar released another album,
            titled DAMN., which featured the hit song “HUMBLE.” and was well
            received by fans and critics alike. He won Grammys for best rap
            album (DAMN.), best rap song, rap performance, and music video (all
            for “HUMBLE.”), and best rap/sung performance (“LOYALTY.”; with
            Rihanna). In addition, DAMN. was the first nonclassical or jazz
            recording to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="date-style">2018:</span>Lamar released the soundtrack

            also featured Jay Rock, Future, and James Blake, won a Grammy for
            best rap performance.
